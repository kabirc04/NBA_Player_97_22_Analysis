# NBA Composite Score Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of NBA players from 1997 to 2022, focusing on the development of offensive and defensive composite scores to evaluate player performance comprehensively. The project aims to identify the statistically best and worst players based on a custom scoring system that factors in multiple performance metrics.

## Objectives
**Visualization and Data Modeling**: Demonstrate and enhance my skillset in data visualization by creating various types of charts, including scatter plots, heatmaps, line charts, and more. The objective was to model and visualize data using multiple parameters, showcasing my ability to handle complex datasets and present findings effectively.

**Offensive Composite Score**: Calculate a composite score that reflects a player's offensive abilities by weighting points, assists, effective field goal percentage, and rebounds.

**Defensive Composite Score**: Develop a composite score to measure a player's defensive impact by weighting steals, blocks, turnovers, and other key defensive stats.

**Total Composite Score**: Combine the offensive and defensive scores to determine the overall performance of each player.

**Best and Worst Players**: Identify the best and worst players statistically, based on their total composite score, and analyze their performance during their respective seasons.

## Key Features
**Custom Composite Scores**: Developed a scoring system where offensive and defensive stats are weighted to create composite scores for each player.

**Visualization**: Created scatter plots and other visualizations to display the relationship between offensive and defensive performance, as well as to highlight top-performing and underperforming players.

**MVP Analysis**: Filtered the data to highlight MVP players and analyze their performance relative to other top players.
Best and Worst Players: Detailed analysis of the players with the highest and lowest composite scores, highlighting significant trends and anomalies.
Findings

**Best Player**: James Harden (2018-19) was identified as the top-performing player based on the composite score, with outstanding offensive contributions across all key metrics.

**Worst Player**: Bruce Bowen (2007-08) was identified as the lowest-performing player, with a significantly negative composite score, reflecting limited contributions across the evaluated metrics.

**Usage**
Clone the repository and explore the R scripts and data visualizations to see how the composite scores are calculated and interpreted. The main script includes all the necessary code to reproduce the analysis and create the visualizations.


## Future Work
**Additional Metrics**: Incorporate more advanced metrics like PER, Win Shares, or Box Plus/Minus for an even more comprehensive analysis.

**Seasonal Comparisons**: Compare composite scores across different NBA eras to analyze how player roles and contributions have evolved over time.

**Team-Based Analysis**: Expand the analysis to evaluate team performance based on the aggregated composite scores of their players.

## Limitations
I acknowledge that this analysis did not include some key statistics, such as win shares, PER 36, and other advanced metrics. As a result, the findings presented may not provide a fully comprehensive answer to the question of who was the statistically best player, and further analysis with additional data would be needed for a more thorough evaluation.
